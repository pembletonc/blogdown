<h2>Creating Custom Microsoft Excel Workbooks</h2>
<p>I’m not exactly fundamentally against Microsoft Excel, but I’m not a member of the fan club either, so to speak. But when it comes to giving the people what they want, be it cake or be it proprietary spreadsheet softwares, I have to oblige. And ultimately what really matters at the end of the day is that the user, and client has the desired end result, not what <em>I</em> prefer as a datascientist. Thus, an important component of datascience is a) giving clients their desired output, and b) ensuring it is an output best suited to their needs - and sometimes that means giving an output in the form of an excel workbook.</p>

<h2>openxlsx to the rescue</h2>
<p><code>openxlsx</code> is a very convenient package which provides a high degree of functionality for created formatted excel workbooks, complete with all the bells and whistles excel users desire, such as expanding columns. wihle you can easily output a list of tibbles with the <code>write.xlsx()</code> function, this only provides minimal format options.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can take a list of tibbles, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>list &lt;- list(cars = cars, WorldPhones = WorldPhones, trees = trees, quakes = quakes)</code></pre>
<p>Establish the various styles desired to be mapped across all worksheets. In this case, I want alternating colours in each column with a unique header style.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hs1 &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = &quot;black&quot;, halign = &quot;center&quot;, fontName = &quot;Arial&quot;,
                   valign = &quot;center&quot;, textDecoration = &quot;bold&quot;, fgFill = &quot;white&quot;,
                   border = &quot;TopBottomLeftRight&quot;)

lightStyle &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = &quot;black&quot;, fgFill = &quot;white&quot;, halign = &quot;right&quot;,
                          valign = &quot;center&quot;)

darkStyle &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = &quot;black&quot;, fgFill = &quot;lightgray&quot;, 
                         halign = &quot;right&quot;, valign = &quot;center&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next, create an empty workbook:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wb &lt;- createWorkbook() #create an empty excel workbook</code></pre>
<p>Create a function for processing each of the tibbles into the empty workbook, noting that the order within the functions matters, as styles must be applied following <code>writeData()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Map(function(data, name){ #function to loop through the list of  objects and apply same formatting
  
  options(&quot;openxlsx.dateFormat&quot; = &quot;dd/mm/yyyy&quot;)

  addWorksheet(wb, name)
  writeData(wb, name, data, borders = c(&quot;surrounding&quot;),
            borderColour = getOption(&quot;openxlsx.borderColour&quot;, &quot;black&quot;),
            borderStyle = getOption(&quot;openxlsx.borderStyle&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;),
            keepNA = FALSE)
  colorRows &lt;- 2:(nrow(data)+1)
  setColWidths(wb, name, cols = 1:ncol(data), widths = &quot;auto&quot;)
  
  addStyle(wb, name, hs1, cols = 1:ncol(data), rows = 1, gridExpand = FALSE)
  
  addStyle(wb, name, lightStyle, rows  = colorRows[which(colorRows %% 2 == 0)],
           cols = 1:ncol(data), gridExpand = TRUE)
  
  addStyle(wb, name, darkStyle, rows  = colorRows[which(colorRows %% 2 == 1)],
           cols = 1:ncol(data), gridExpand = TRUE)
  
    }, list, names(list))</code></pre>
<p>And lastly, save the desired output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveWorkbook(wb, &quot;excel_workbook.xlsx&quot;, TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Which gives a lovely formatted excel workbook:</p>

<p>I got most of the information for this blog from the very helpful <code>openxlsx</code> vignettes, from stackoverflow responses, and the idea for mapping the function from a post on Rbloggers. I have to say, my work received immediate postive feedback from clients and colleagues who were very weary about recieving completely unformatted .csv files from me!</p>
