## About this blog

This blog is a living document, a work-in-progress of the various ways which my interests of international development, urban planning and spatial analysis intersect with the *R programming language*. You can find all of the source code for everything on the site on my [github page](https://github.com/pembletonc), and linked within each respective post. 

I am highly indebted to the R community for providing the opportunities for self-learning needed to perform pretty much everything on the site, including its very existence. 

## About the author

Corey Pembleton is an international development evaluation analyst, veteran, and geography graduate from Ontario, Canada, who is currently based in Montreal. [Get in touch](https://twitter.com/coreypembleton) if you want to talk about various nerdy subjects such as urban geography, rstats, or datascience type of stuff!



Some of the resources which have been the most influential to me:

### Data Analysis and Manipulation

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), by [Garret Groleman](https://github.com/garrettgman) & [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz)
*Learning modern data tidying and management using 'tidy' methods. It features a walk-through guide on data table manipulation, iteration, and how to communicate findings effectively*

### Rmarkdown, blogdown, and Hugo website development

* [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), by [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui), [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/) and [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/), all of whom have an abundance of additional resources and insights into website creation in R Markdown.

### Spatial analysis and visualization in R

* [Geocomputation with R](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/) by [Robin Lovelace](http://t.co/puWMFprmiQ), [Jakub Nowosad](https://t.co/Yn0lBxhpUZ), and [Jannes Muenchow](https://jannes-m.github.io) *A detailed walkthrough with information on how to perform tasks of a traditional GIS within the R ecosystem, with walkthroughs for analysis, map creation and rmarkdown integration of vector and raster spatial computation*
