<h2>Media Monitoring Analysis:</h2>
<p>As a consultant, I have to wear many different hats. Some days I’m munging a portfolio, another leading a focus group, and on another catching a flight to Kathmandu to participate in a workshop. It’s the beauty of my job, and keeps things spicy. Not doing the same thing all the time means I’m learning constantly, which is what this story is about.</p>
<p>A client with a well-established media presence wanted a “traditional and social media analysis” to understand the reach and impact of their program. We helped with the analysis and details, but they ended hiring a specialist on the subject to collect the data, give us the stats, etc. I had a feeling that with a bit of looking around, I could pull of a similar piece of work.</p>
<p>In general there are a few things people commonly want out of a media monitoring analysis: Reach (how many are seeing your content), engagement (who are your followers?), and Content analysis (what does the content say).</p>
<p>I’ll use the <code>rtweet</code> package developed by <a href="https://mikewk.com/">M. Kearny</a> for this post, and take some ideas from helpful sources on the topic and other brilliant programmers doing fun-useful things with the package(like <a href="https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/">here</a> and <a href="http://rpubs.com/ben_bellman/rtweet_tidygraph">here</a>. For no reason in particular, this post will feature images and gifs from Doctor Who.</p>
