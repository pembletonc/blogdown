## Let them have excel!

I'm not exactly fundamentally against Microsoft Excel, but I'm not a member of the fan club either, so to speak. But when it comes to giving the people what they want, be it cake or be it proprietary spreadsheet softwares, I have to oblige. And ultimately what really matters at the end of the day is that the user, and client has the desired end result, not what *I* prefer as a datascientist. Thus, an important component of datascience is a) giving clients their desired output, and b) ensuring it is an output best suited to their needs - and sometimes that means giving an output in the form of an excel workbook. 

## openxlsx to the rescue

```openxlsx``` is a very convenient package which provides a high degree of functionality for created formatted excel workbooks, complete with all the bells and whistles excel users desire, such as expanding columns. wihle you can easily output a list of tibbles with  the ```write.xlsx()``` function, this only provides minimal format options. 

Alternatively, we can take a list of tibbles, e.g.:

```{r}
list <- list(cars = cars, WorldPhones = WorldPhones, trees = trees, quakes = quakes)
```

Establish the various styles desired to be mapped across all worksheets. In this case, I want alternating colours in each column with a unique header style.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hs1 <- createStyle(fontColour = "black", halign = "center", fontName = "Arial",
                   valign = "center", textDecoration = "bold", fgFill = "white",
                   border = "TopBottomLeftRight")

lightStyle <- createStyle(fontColour = "black", fgFill = "white", halign = "right",
                          valign = "center")

darkStyle <- createStyle(fontColour = "black", fgFill = "lightgray", 
                         halign = "right", valign = "center")
```

Next, create an empty workbook:

```{r}
wb <- createWorkbook() #create an empty excel workbook
```

Create a function for processing each of the tibbles into the empty workbook, noting that the order within the functions matters, as styles must be applied following ```writeData()```.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
Map(function(data, name){ #function to loop through the list of  objects and apply same formatting
  
  options("openxlsx.dateFormat" = "dd/mm/yyyy")

  addWorksheet(wb, name)
  writeData(wb, name, data, borders = c("surrounding"),
            borderColour = getOption("openxlsx.borderColour", "black"),
            borderStyle = getOption("openxlsx.borderStyle", "thin"),
            keepNA = FALSE)
  colorRows <- 2:(nrow(data)+1)
  setColWidths(wb, name, cols = 1:ncol(data), widths = "auto")
  
  addStyle(wb, name, hs1, cols = 1:ncol(data), rows = 1, gridExpand = FALSE)
  
  addStyle(wb, name, lightStyle, rows  = colorRows[which(colorRows %% 2 == 0)],
           cols = 1:ncol(data), gridExpand = TRUE)
  
  addStyle(wb, name, darkStyle, rows  = colorRows[which(colorRows %% 2 == 1)],
           cols = 1:ncol(data), gridExpand = TRUE)
  
    }, list, names(list))

```

And lastly, save the desired output:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
saveWorkbook(wb, "excel_workbook.xlsx", TRUE)
```

Which gives a lovely formatted excel workbook:

I got most of the information for this blog from the very helpful ```openxlsx``` vignettes, from stackoverflow responses, and the idea for mapping the function from a post on Rbloggers. I have to say, my work received immediate postive feedback from clients and colleagues who were very weary about recieving completely unformatted .csv files from me!
