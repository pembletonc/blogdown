## Pot stocks: boom or bust?

I personally have little or no interest in capital markets, but I have to say they are well-structured quantitative datasets to play with. Over the past two years in Canada there have been interesting political shifts leaning towards, and away from, the legalization of pot across the country. This, I hypothosize, has resulted in interesting market fluctuations as well. 

### What I'm working with

[Matt Dancho & Davis Vaughan](https://github.com/business-science/tidyquant) created the ```tidyquant``` R package, which builds upon the widely-used ```quantmod``` and ```tidyverse``` packages. With ```tidyquant``` I am able to download and process the relevant data. My banker (cough) brother told me to look into the "Horizons Weed ETF", which is an exchange trade fund which holds stocks in some 40 weed companies, which I've used to create an object from, *holdings*. Some of these companies are only available on the Canadian Toronto Stock Exchange, meaning I couldn't dig up their financial data, however I could for the top 10 holdings which are also on NASDAQ, so can work with these.
### Getting the data and Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, cache=TRUE}
weed_stock_prices <- tq_get(c("GWPH", "IIPR", "INSY", "SMG",
                               "XXII","ZYNE", "CGC", "APHQF", "CRON"),
                             get = "stock.prices", from = "2000-01-01")
```

```tidyquant``` gives me everything I need in a single function, which is remarkable to say the least. ```tq_get()``` allows me to extract stock prices for each of the companies, which, when collecting since the year 2000, gives a nearly 15,000 row dataset of daily stock price changes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weed_stock_prices %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(`Daily Occurences on Market` = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Daily Occurences on Market`)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 11,
                            full_width = FALSE,
                            position = "float_right") %>% 
  kableExtra::footnote(general = "All data from YahooFinance")

```

It looks like there are some new entrants to the market, and some who have been around for a long time; with the larger companies (such as SMG, Miracle Grow) with seemingly more diverse types of business.

Looking below, there is something interesting with the downfall of MiracleGrow, but what's more interesting for this analysis is capturing the time when all stocks in the ETF have data, which looks to be around 2014.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
weed_stock_prices %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = symbol)) +
  theme_tq(base_family = "Lato") +
  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format("%Y"), date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text()) +
  ylab("Daily Closing Value (USD)")
```


Looking closer only at the dates beyond 2014, a much more interesting picture of the ETF arises: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
weed_stock_prices %>%
  filter(date > "2013-12-31") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = symbol)) +
  theme_tq(base_family = "Lato") +
  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format("%m-%Y"), date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text()) +
  ylab("Daily Closing Value (USD)")
```


### Digging Deeper: Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

While it is interesting to know what the closing values of stocks are, something which investors are interested in is the expected return and risks of stocks, measured by growth and risk. One method for measuring this is through the CAPM. As described by Investopedia (via Matt Dancho), CAPM is:

> The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. CAPM is widely used throughout finance for the pricing of risky securities, generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and calculating costs of capital.

Through a comparison of the only marijuana ETF on the NASDAQ I could find, "MJ", we can see how the portfolio is performing by building a CAPM through the comparison of asset performance ("ra") to the asset baseline (rb). Important CAPM outputs to be considered are the alpha and beta values, attributes which are measures of growth and risk, respectively. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

performance <- weed_stock_prices %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               col_rename = "Ra")

baseline <- "MJ" %>% 
  tq_get(get = "stock.prices",
         from = "2014-01-01",
         to = "2018-08-13") %>% 
  tq_transmute(select = adjusted,
               mutate_fun = periodReturn,
               period = "monthly",
               col_rename = "Rb")

RaRb <- left_join(performance, baseline, by = "date")

RaRb_capm <- RaRb %>%
  tq_performance(Ra = Ra, 
                 Rb = Rb, 
                 performance_fun = table.CAPM)

RaRb_capm %>% 
  select(symbol, Alpha, Beta, Correlation, `R-squared`) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 11,
                            full_width = FALSE,
                            position = "center")

```

Looking at the alpha values of our stocks, we see some with clearly higher growth ratios of Alpha, and Annualized Alpha, with the APHQF (Aphria Inc.), which grows and distributes pharmaceutical pot. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
pal <-  wesanderson::wes_palette(9, name = "FantasticFox1", type = "continuous")

RaRb_capm %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Alpha, y = AnnualizedAlpha)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = symbol)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", lwd = .5, alpha = .3, col = "purple")+
  theme_tq(base_family = "Lato") +
  scale_fill_discrete(pal = pal) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text()) +
  ggtitle("CAPM Alpha Values of Portfolio Against MJ ETF")
```

Looking at the Beta, or risk values, we see that most of the companies are considered low-risk against the ETF, with the exception of two: IIPR and CGC. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
RaRb_capm %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Beta`, y = `Correlation`)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = symbol)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", lwd = .5, alpha = .3, col = "purple")+
  theme_tq(base_family = "Lato") +
  scale_fill_tq()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text()) +
  ggtitle("CAPM Beta Correlation Values of Portfolio Against MJ ETF")

```


This has provided a few insights into any further financial analysis, and I've learned that a) the finance world is immensely jargony, and b) I need to do FAR more homework before being able to say more than a simple causal analysis!
