<p>This blog is a living document, a work-in-progress of the various ways which my interests of international development, statistics, and spatial analysis intersect with the <em>R programming language</em>. You can find the source code for everything on the site on my <a href="https://github.com/pembletonc">github page</a>, and linked within each respective post.</p>
