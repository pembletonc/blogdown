## About this blog

This blog is by and large a living document, a work-in-progress of the various ways which my interests of international development, urban planning and spatial analysis intersect with the *R programming language*. You can find all of the source code for everything on the site on my [github page](https://github.com/pembletonc), and given that some content I work on may be confidential, I'll always try to keep my work as open and transparent as possible.   

## About Me

Following a short detour at the age of 19 which saw my being deployed to Afghanistan with the Canadian military in 2009 (yes, Canada has a military, and yes, we were in Kandahar, Afghanistan), I was very joyfully accepted into the University of Waterloo's International Development program. It was here I became most interested in the connection between international development, the environment, and urbanism; an interest I continue to build upon today professionally and personally (aren't those two the same thing?).
