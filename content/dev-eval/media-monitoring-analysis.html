<h2>Media Monitoring Analysis:</h2>
<p>As a consultant, I have to wear many different hats. Some days I’m munging a portfolio, another leading a focus group, and on another catching a flight to Kathmandu to participate in a workshop. It’s the beauty of my job, and keeps things spicy. Not doing the same thing all the time means I’m learning constantly, which is what this story is about.</p>
<p>A client with a well-established media presence wanted a “traditional and social media analysis” to understand the reach and impact of their program. We helped with the analysis and details, but they ended hiring a specialist on the subject to collect the data, give us the stats, etc. I had a feeling that with a bit of looking around, I could pull of a similar piece of work.</p>
<p>In general there are a few things people commonly want out of a media monitoring analysis: Reach (how many are seeing your content), engagement (who are your followers?), and Content analysis (what does the content say).</p>
<p>I’ll use the <code>rtweet</code> package developed by <a href="https://mikewk.com/">M. Kearny</a> for this post, and take some ideas from helpful sources on the topic and other brilliant programmers doing fun-useful things with the package(like <a href="https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/">here</a> and <a href="http://rpubs.com/ben_bellman/rtweet_tidygraph">here</a>. For no reason in particular, this post will feature images and gifs from Doctor Who.</p>

<div id="reach" class="section level2">
<h2>Reach</h2>
<p>How often someone tweets can be a simplistic determination of their reach, especially when considering the amount of followers they have. Following the <code>rtweet</code> vignette, it goes like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#COP24&quot;, n = 1500, include_rts = FALSE,
                    retryonratelimit = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Searching for tweets...</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Finished collecting tweets!</code></pre>
<p><img src="/dev-eval/media-monitoring-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Understanding tweet “reach” can be accompanied by understanding the relationship between who is “retweeting” the same tweets. Using the <code>ggraph</code> package, the resultant collected tweets can be filtered and unnested according to retweets by screen name, and converted into a graph object using <code>igraph</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(tweets, retweet_count &gt; 0) %&gt;% 
  select(screen_name, mentions_screen_name) %&gt;%
  unnest(mentions_screen_name) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(mentions_screen_name)) %&gt;% 
  igraph::graph_from_data_frame() -&gt; rt_g

#clean up the names, and only use the names with X amount of retweets
V(rt_g)$node_label &lt;- unname(ifelse(degree(rt_g)[V(rt_g)] &gt; 10, names(V(rt_g)), &quot;&quot;)) 
V(rt_g)$node_size &lt;- unname(ifelse(degree(rt_g)[V(rt_g)] &gt; 10, degree(rt_g), 0)) </code></pre>
<p>With a resulting graphical representation showing the users who have been most commonly re-tweeted (remembering that this is for a small set of tweets only, changing the size of the tweet collection will drastically change the results).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(rt_g, layout = &#39;linear&#39;, circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_arc(edge_width=0.125, aes(alpha=..index..)) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label=node_label, size=node_size),
                  label.size=0, fill=&quot;#ffffff66&quot;, segment.colour=&quot;springgreen&quot;,
                  color=&quot;slateblue&quot;, repel=TRUE, fontface=&quot;bold&quot;) +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_size_area(trans=&quot;sqrt&quot;) +
  labs(title=&quot;Retweet Relationships&quot;, subtitle=&quot;Most retweeted screen names labeled.\nDarkers edges == more retweets. Node size == larger degree&quot;) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>This gives us some idea of who are the most visible actors in the media set being analyzed, and opens the door for future engagement potential - if some names stand out as being active in certain topics, how can they be better engaged with to extend the client’s reach?</p>
</div>
<div id="engagement---influence" class="section level2">
<h2>Engagement - Influence</h2>
<p>Understanding the level of engagement certain content has is helpful in determining the overall effectiveness of social media pieces. One way to determine engagement is through an interpretation of the level of influence single tweets, campaigns, or accounts have based on the interaction by followers.</p>
<p>Like many of the useful functions found in <code>rtweet</code>, <code>get_followers()</code>, allows me to count the followers of followers, a pseudo-primary influence measure. This approach is a quick take from <a href="https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/crawling-followers-to-approximate-primary-influence.html">rud.is</a>, and like he states should further integrate favourites and retweets for a more accurate measure. Using his “influence_snapshot” function, I can create a rapid measure of potential overall influence, by user:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>influence_snapshot &lt;- function(user, trans=c(&quot;log10&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;)) {
  
  user &lt;- user[1]
  trans &lt;- match.arg(tolower(trimws(trans[1])), c(&quot;log10&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;))
  
  user_info &lt;- lookup_users(user)
  
  user_followers &lt;- get_followers(user_info$user_id)
  uf_details &lt;- lookup_users(user_followers$user_id)
  
  primary_influence &lt;- scales::comma(sum(c(uf_details$followers_count, user_info$followers_count)))
  
   filter(uf_details, followers_count &gt; 0) %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(followers_count)) +
    geom_density(aes(y=..count..), color=&quot;lightslategray&quot;, fill=&quot;lightslategray&quot;,
                 alpha=2/3, size=1) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0), trans=&quot;log10&quot;, labels=scales::comma) +
    labs(
      x=&quot;Number of Followers of Followers (log scale)&quot;, 
      y=&quot;Number of Followers&quot;,
      title=sprintf(&quot;Follower chain distribution of %s (@%s)&quot;, user_info$name, user_info$screen_name),
      subtitle=sprintf(&quot;Follower count: %s; Primary influence/reach: %s&quot;, 
                       scales::comma(user_info$followers_count),
                       scales::comma(primary_influence))
    ) +
    theme_minimal(grid=&quot;XY&quot;) -&gt; gg
  
   print(gg)
  
  return(invisible(list(user_info=user_info, follower_details=uf_details)))
  
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>influence_snapshot(&quot;juliasilge&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we can determine the “primary influence / reach” of Dr. Julia Silge, lead datascientist and text mining pioneer at stackoverflow at nearly 6M people.</p>

</div>
<p>With the addition of other metrics and when broken down during specific time periods (e.g. to measure a campaign’s influence), this could be a powerful tool to determine influence, as it stands, it is easy to see how this amount of “influence” can be interpreted in many different ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="content-analysis---sentiment-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Content Analysis - sentiment analysis</h2>
<p>Content analysis of traditional and social media is a long-standing method for interpreting the details of media content itself, the meat and potatoes of what’s being said (rather than how many people said something). Traditional content analysis means having a human read and categorize certain types of media according to what is being said in the article. For example if there are positive or negative references to a program or organization, would be performing an analysis of the overall sentiment of a specific topic.</p>
<p>Similarly, the content of socia media content can be analyze for sentiment. I’ve already went into this in a <a href="">small amount of detail</a>, and can explore the topic further now. By cross-referencing single words, two-word combinations (bi-gram), or multiple word combinations (n-gram) to specific words within the <a href="">lexicon</a>, an overall sentiment rating can be determined.</p>
