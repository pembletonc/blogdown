## Working with Survey Data: Processing for Use

Depending on the survey software used, the results exported as excel or .csv can often be fairly messy, and processing that data manually in excel can be time consuming and is prone to copy/paste or other munging errors. Using a real example (questions and stakeholder names changed), I present here one fairly replicable way to process survey data exported from SurveyMonkey.

## Importing

Unlike a fairly clean dataset, SurveyMonkey results (in all instances I have seen) are exported with two or more header rows, the first used as a descriptive row for a main question, the second for the question itself.
