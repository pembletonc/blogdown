## Bienvenue

Hello, and welcome.  

This blog is several things. First and foremost, it is a living journal for the various ways in which I seek to explore how using tools and methods in statistics and data science can be integrated into international development evaluation, urban planning and environmental sustainability.  


In its simpleset form, this entails the exploration of how the quantitative and qualitative data sources used to form judgement in evaluative practices can be better informed through analysis, representation, and automation in the R programming language.
