## purrr tutorial: Using purrr and working with nested dataframes

I'm still learning the functionality behind purrr, the tidyverse package which helps with the commonly found challenges in data management relating to splitting, applying analysis, and recombining the data. In this post, I walk through my progress in various purrr tutorials, and a few use cases of the ```purrr::map()``` functions. I will be doing some of this with a Canadian census dataset I created in a [previous post](https://coreypembleton.netlify.com/space-stats/canadian-census-data-cleaning-pt1/). Here we go down the purrr rabbit hole...

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Census_2011 <- read_csv("./Census_2011.csv")

```

### First thing's first - understanding lists, lists of lists, and lists of dataframes

purrr, and its ```map_*()``` functions are fundamental to executing functions in the tidyverse. I have used ```map()``` and different purrr functions in the past, but really didn't understand the underlying mechanisms behind the functions.  

To understand ```map()```, I realized I need to understand lists, and ```tidyr::nest()```. Starting with Hadley's R For Data Science (r4ds) section on [vectors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#introduction-13), and [this note](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/02/02/tidyr-0-4-0/) detailing the ```nest()``` ```tidyr``` function, I could gain some understanding around lists, lists of lists, and lists of dataframes.

From r4ds, I learned that lists (also known as recursive vectors) are a type of vector  which unlike atomic vectors (e.g. logical, integer, character, etc.) can contain a mix of different types of atomic vectors. The structure of lists can be  viewed using ```str()```:

```{r}
y <- list("Canada", 32500, TRUE, 1L)
str(y)
```

Lists can contain other lists, which is structured hierarchically:

```{r}
z <- list(list("Canada", 32500), list(TRUE, 1L) )
str(z)
```

The hierarchical structure of the nested list is important when considering the composition of a list containing multiple dataframes in a nested manner, and subsequently how the ```purrr::map()``` family of functions work. Interestingly, dataframes and tibbles are also lists, or augmented lists, with tibbles having the classes tbl_df, tbl, and data.frame, as can be seen with the ```attributes()``` function (not shown). 

```{r}
#dataframe of a .csv derived dataset:

census_small_df <- Census_2011[,3:10]
typeof(census_small_df)

#tibble of a .csv-derived dataset

census_small <- as.tibble(census_small_df)

typeof(census_small)

```

### Nested Dataframes  

Hadley Wickham describes a nested dataframe as: 

> "In a grouped data frame, you have **one row per observation**, and additional metadata define the groups. In a nested data frame, you have **one row per group**, and the individual observations are stored in a column that is a list of data frames."

And to see what the looks like I can take the census dataset, group it by province, and see how the nested dataframe looks:

```{r}
(nested_census <- census_small %>% 
  group_by(PRNAME) %>%
  nest())
```

Aside from being neat, something interesting is added - a new column "data", which is a list class class. Looking at Newfoundland and Labrador's dataframe can be done through the same operators as with lists: with [, [[, or $, which shows the ungrouped data, in this case of the province: 

```{r}
nested_census$data[[5]]
```

Nesting and pulling out one of the "nested" dataframes in its ungrouped format is helpful for seeing how data is structured. Now I'd like to look at how this process can be used in analysis, particularly when combined with the ```purr::map()``` family of functions. 

## Back to map()

Now that I have my head wrapped around these structures, I can get back to the point: ```purrr::map()```. On CRAN, the function family of ```map_()``` is titled as "apply a function to each element of a vector" - which for me is the simplest way to understand what the function does.

The rdocumentation gives some examples which I'd like to breakdown further, and refer to some other helpful stackoverflow and rdocumentation ntoes to expand on what I see happening. 

### map() use case 1: passing functions through a list of vectors

In rdocumentation the first use of ```map()```, is presented as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1:10 %>%
  map(rnorm, n = 10) %>%
  map_dbl(mean)
```

The first line and ```map()``` give a randomly generated normal distribution of each vector in the 1:10 sequence, with the result looking like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
1:10 %>%
  map(rnorm, n = 10)
```

Based on the structure ```map()``` passes a function (```rnorm()```) to each vector in 1:10. 

In the third line another function, ```mean()``` is passed through each of the 10 rnorm generated values in the list:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
1:10 %>%
  map(rnorm, n = 10) %>%
  map_dbl(mean)
```

### map() use case #2: passing a formula through parts of a dataframe  
Another use-case which I see often is to pass a formula through various pieces of a dataframe. In the rdocumentation script sample below, we see three uses of ```map()```, a formula object being passed through a split dataframe, a function ```summary()``` being called, and a named vector from a nested list "r.squared" being called:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

The second line, ```split(.$cyl)```, uses the base r function ```split()``` to split the dataframe based upon the 3 cyl groups, 4, 6, and 8.  

In the third line,  ```map()``` is being used to pass a formula object across each of the three groups created, which is a regression between the mpg and wt variables. Formulas in ```map()``` can take three arguments:  

1.  single use arguments: ```.```; 
2.  two-argument function: ```.x``` and ```.y``` and; 
3.  more than two arguments: ```..1```, ```..2```, etc.

Hence, ```map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x))``` will pass the formula, with ```.x``` meaning that ```map``` will pass the formula across all unused data variables present in the data frame. It will have the same result using ``` map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))```. 

> Note on the tilde (~): tildes are used in formula objects in R, such as within the lm() formula used above. with map() there is an additional ~ before the lm() function when used in map() to [identify the expression as being a formula object](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44834446/what-is-meaning-of-first-tilde-in-purrrmap). 


In the subsequent lines, map passed the```summary()``` function over each of the resultant groups' linear model, and the ```map_dbl()``` does what ```map()``` does best: it passes through a nested list (summary output) and extracts based on the character vector(list) named "r.squared". We could replace this with other summary variables in the list, such as adj.r.squared, sigma, fstatistic, and more.

### Use-case for nest() and map() together 

In the above examples, there is a combination of base R functions and "tidyverse" tools. Using ```nest()``` over ```split()``` offers a few benefits such as smoother organization of the workflow, especially when combining other operations. The below example introduces ```broom::glance()```, which is a function well paired with ```nest()``` and ```map()```, and plan to explore in detail in a future post.

With a nesting and mapping approach, the workflow would instead look something like this:

```{r}
(model_summary <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)),
    model_summaries = map(model, broom::glance),
    model_coef = map(model, broom::tidy))
)

```

Which gives us a nested dataframe with the tidied broom results and glances. Like in the nest example above, these results can then be unnested, to reveal the statistical summaries from each model:

```{r}
model_summary %>% 
  unnest(model_summaries, .drop = TRUE)

```

By nesting instead of splitting, the subsequent mutate and map functions could more smoothly fit into a workflow, especially when the desire is to create a quick graphic to check results:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model_summary %>% 
  unnest(model_summaries, .drop = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(cyl), y = r.squared)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Cylinders", y = expression(R^{2}))
```

### Wrap-up
Learning a single additional tool in R for a beginner often means needing to learn or brush up on many more concepts to fully grasp the functionality behind the scenes. Wanting to explore a single topic opened the doors to multiple concepts and functions, and I'm glad I entered that rabbit hole.
